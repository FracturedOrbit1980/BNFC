# Football

Club platform (Next.js App Router). The product specification is in `PROMPT.md`.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 and choose Club admin, Head coach, or Player. The official drill library is included. The imported players start on U12 Prem, and each one can be edited. Other age groups start empty. Club records are saved in this browser.

The hosted app is https://fracturedorbit1980.github.io/Football/

This app is a static export, so `npm run build` does not need secrets. Supabase credentials stay optional; see `.env.example`.

## Supabase

`main` added the club schema in `supabase/migrations/20261003120000_initial_schema.sql` (tables, row level security, and a signup trigger). The screens in this branch do not call that database yet. They keep the club in the browser. Apply the migration when a server connection is wired up:

```bash
npx supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF
npx supabase db push
```

The migration does not insert auth users. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` only for that later connection.
